## Background

The natural biological function of the skin is to protect the body against harmful infections by hindering the intrusion of foreign pathogens.[^1]

In terms of protection, the skin serves a dual functionality: the physical barrier provided by the stratum corneum and the immunological barrier stimulated by the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the dermis and epidermis.[^1]

In recent years, several findings have established that stimulating the APCs underneath the stratum corneum can provide several advantages in terms of vaccine administration over conventional methods.[^1]

Such “intradermal immunization” methods have been investigated worldwide.[^1]

As a result, some of the intradermal vaccine delivery methods that were developed include the Mantoux technique, ballistic vaccination, epidermal powder immunization (EPI), jet injector, tattoo immunization, and microneedles.[^1]

## Types of Vaccines

- Vaccines may comprise living, attenuated microorganisms, inactivated or killed microorganisms or purified bacterial and viral components.[^2]
- Recent innovations include the development of DNA and mRNA vaccines.
  - These include vaccines that encode for the antigen when introduced directly into host tissues.
  - These also include vaccines that might be delivered by non-pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Lactococcuslactis) or otherwise by viral vectors (e.g., adenovirus).[^2]

### Live Vaccines

Live, infective microorganisms, attenuated in their pathogenicity but retaining their ability to infect, can be used to confer protective immunity.[^2]

Two major advantages from the use of live vaccines:

1. The immunisation mimics the course of a natural infection such that only a single exposure is required to render an individual immune.
2. The exposure may be mediated through the natural route of infection (e.g., oral), thereby stimulating an immune response that is appropriate to a particular disease.[^2]
 
Disadvantages associated with the use of live vaccines:

1. Live, attenuated vaccines, administered through the natural route of infection, will replicate in the patient and could be transmitted to others.
2. If attenuation is reduced during the replication process, infections might result.
3. The course of their action, and possible side effects, might be affected by the infection and immunological status of the patient.[^2]

### Inactivated (Killed) and Component Vaccines [^2]

- Since these vaccines are unable to evoke a natural infection profile for the release of antigen, they must be administered on several occasions.[^2]
- Immunity may not reach optimal levels until the course of immunisation is complete and, except for toxin-dominated diseases where the immunogen is a toxoid, is unlikely to match the performance of a live vaccine.[^2]
- The specificity of the immune response generated in the patient may initially be low.
- A vaccine composed of a relatively crude cocktail of killed cells, and an immune response directed only partially towards antigenic components of the pathogen will also result in low immune response and an increase in the possibility of adverse reactions in the patient.
