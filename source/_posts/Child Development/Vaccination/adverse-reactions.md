## Covid-19 Vaccines

Little is known about their side effects.[^1]

### Diabetes

- A link between COVID-19 vaccination, specifically Pfizer-BioNTech, with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.[^1]
- Cases have been reported with new-onset Diabetes Mellitus with DKA/HHS (Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state) after administration of the vaccine, with one case series describing hyperglycemic crises precipitated by Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.[^1]
- Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how SARS-CoV-2 may trigger new-onset or exacerbate known DM, including:
  - (1) SARS-Cov can infect pancreatic beta cells directly, or cause direct or bystander destruction of pancreatic beta cells by binding to pancreatic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors.[^1]
  - (2) Releasing of cortisol and catecholamines because of the acute stress caused by SARS-CoV-2.[^1]
  - (3) Disruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and angiotensin 1-7 balance, favoring upregulation of the pro-inflammatory angiotensin II pathway with downregulation of the vasodilatory, protective angiotensin 1-7 pathway with local, detrimental effects at the pancreas.[^1]
  - (4) Infection will lead to dysregulation of the immune system, triggered systemic inflammatory response and release of cytokines, a “cytokine storm.” [^1]
- An obese patient, who had been pre-diabetic for more than 20 years, suddenly presented with DKA (Diabetic ketoacidosis) only a few days after COVID-19 vaccination, with positive autoantibodies and requiring insulin.[^1]
- Severe hyperglycemia including HHS (hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state) and DKA (Diabetic ketoacidosis) may be triggered by COVID-19 vaccination.[^2]
- The robust inflammatory response and “cytokine storm” may be the primary precipitant.[^2]
- Data suggest that immune dysregulation caused by the vaccine may worsen diabetes and supports the hypothesis that a similar mechanism underlies the association between COVID-19 infection and diabetes.[^2]
- COVID-19 vaccine may trigger hyperglycemia.[^2]
- COVID-19 vaccine triggers a robust systemic inflammatory immune response.[^2]

### Graves Disease

Graves' disease is an immune system disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism).

- A link between COVID-19 vaccine and Graves' disease cases has been hypothesized.[^1]
- The vaccine is stated to contain four lipids, of which two are polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid conjugates that stabilize the lipid nanoparticles and reduce the activity of non-specific binding proteins.[^1]
- PEGs may act as an adjuvant and induce an immune response in predisposed individuals, as there are reports of reactions to PEGs.[^1]
- There is not only a link between COVID-19 vaccines and diabetes but also a link with autoimmune conditions entirely.[^1]
- Since Graves' disease and LADA (Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults) are autoimmune pathologies, this theory possibly explains both.[^1]
