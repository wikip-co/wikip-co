- Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of life to promote adequate infant growth and development, and to reduce infant morbidity and mortality.
- Exclusive breastfeeding is the gold standard for infant feeding because it promotes adequate growth and development, excellent nutritional status, and appropriate psychological development.
- Due to the special composition of breast milk in bioactive and immunogenic substances, it effectively protects against numerous infectious diseases, mainly pneumonia and other respiratory infections, diarrhea, and allergic processes.
- Breastfeeding promotes an optimal psycho-affective motherâ€“child relationship and has a very low cost, practically nil.
- Indeed, WHO and UNICEF recommend starting breastfeeding within the first hour of birth and being exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life.
- From the age of 6 months, children should begin eating safe and adequate complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for up to 2 years and beyond.
- Breastfeeding protects against disease in both developing and developed countries and is beneficial not only for infants but also for mothers.
- Breastfeeding may protect later in life against obesity and metabolic diseases.
- Breastfeeding is associated with better performance on intelligence tests.
- Women who breastfeed have a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers.
